# Excel-Challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since they began in the late aughts. Everyone from indie creators to famous celebrities have utilized crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.
Getting funded on a crowdfunding website requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this project, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 generated sample projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

# Crowdfunding report analysing its success based on the categories of funding, relation to the time of the year and the country of origin

Crowdfunding is the popular campaigning method of generating funding for the project(s) and product(s) that one is about to launch. Most popular platforms of crowdfunding used in the recent times include Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It allows for both generating funding from the interested parties and provide a platform to create interest in support of the project/products to be launched. However, it always seems a gamble to predict which crowdfunding will be successful and which one would be a failure. 

Hence, in the following project, I tried to study the performance of the different crowdfunding based on the relevant performance matrices.  These included success of crowdfunding based on categories and subcategories of funding and its success at various time of the year. 

Based on the trends that was evident in the current crowdfunding data, we could derive the following conclusions –
1.	Theatre, films, videos and music campaigns (constituting 30% of the categories) were the most successful crowdfunding campaigns. This category obtained 70% of the crowdfunding compared to rest of the categories.
2.	When the performance data was compared based on the sub-categories of crowdfunding, ‘Plays’ seemed to be the most successful one obtaining over 34% funding of all the campaigns sub-categories.
3.	Campaigns performed favourably during the period from May through to mid-July consistently throughout the 10-year period. 
4.	Crowdfunding campaigns from USA, Canada, Great Britain and Italy performed more successfully compared to other countries.
5.	Even though, the data provided was most recent (09/01/2010 -27/01/2020); it would have been helpful to study the trends in crowdfunding for historical data going back 2-3 decades. This would enable one to study the trend/change in trend for the last 3-4 decades and hence be able to predict (with certain level of confidence) future performance of these crowdfunding campaigns. 
6.	In addition to the analyses already performed (in the attached Excel sheet) and discussed; one could analyse the data to see the performance of each country and what trend they follow with regards to various categories/subcategories of campaigns. These might show how consistently or not they perform over time and whether would be more profitable to invest in such campaigns. For example, are crowdfunding campaigns under arts categories more successful and consistant from Italy; are crowdfunding from USA in media/play/entertainment categories perform more consistently over the 2-3 decades etc.
